<h2>MABEL'S COW.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="93" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE cow nearest to you in the picture is Mabel's
cow; and Mabel Brittan is the taller of the two
girls on the bridge. I will tell you why the
cow is called Mabel's cow.</div>

<p>Her family live in a wild but beautiful part
of New Hampshire, where it is very cold in winter, and
pretty warm in summer. There are only two small houses
within a mile of her father's. He keeps cows, and makes
nice butter from the cream.</p>

<p>Not long ago he bought a cow at a great bargain, as he
thought; for she was a fine-looking young cow, and the
price he paid for her was only twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>But, before he had got through the first milking of her, he
began to think she was dear at any price. She would kick
over the pail, make vicious plunges, and try to hook him.
Indeed, he grew afraid of her, she was so violent.</p>

<p>He took down a heavy whip, and was about to strike her
in great anger, when his little daughter Mabel caught his
arm, and said, "She will never be good for any thing if you
strike her. Let me try to manage her."</p>

<p>And, before Mr. Brittan could prevent her, Mabel had her
arm round the cow's neck, and was calling her all the sweet
pet names she could think of.</p>

<p>"All that is very well," said her father; "but just you
try to milk her: that's all. No, you sha'n't venture. It
would be as much as your life is worth."</p>

<p>"I am very sure she will let me milk her," said Mabel.
"Do not forbid my trying. She looks at me out of her big
eyes as if she thought me her friend."</p>

<p>So Mabel took the tin pail, and sat down on the little low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
milking-stool; and soon, to her father's astonishment, she finished
milking, the cow having stood all the while as quiet
as a lamb.</p>

<p>It was found that the cow had been badly treated by the
man who had owned her, and who had been in the habit of
milking her. Being a high-spirited beast, she then gave him
so much trouble, that he was soon glad to be rid of her.</p>

<p>She would now let no one touch her but Mabel: so Mr.
Brittan finally said that the cow should be Mabel's cow, and
that all the butter which the cow yielded should be hers.
But Mabel is a generous girl; and so she shares the money
she earns. Her mother, her sister Emily, and her brothers
Oliver and Frank, all get a part of it.</p>

<p>Mabel has given the cow a name; and the cow will come
to her when she calls her by name. The name is a very
pretty one for a cow, I think. It is Dido.</p>

<h2>HARRY AND THE BIG "POP-CORNER."</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Little Harold</span> was delighted, one winter morning, to
hear that he could go to his grandpapa's with his mother,
for a few days. He had often been there in summer, when
the grass was green, and flowers were blooming around the
old homestead; but this was his first <i>winter</i> visit.</p>

<p>A pleasant ride of forty miles by the railway, then a
short ride in an old-fashioned stage-sleigh, and the sober
old horses, with their jingling bells, stopped before grandpa's
pleasant home.</p>

<p>Harry ran up to the door, shouting, "We've come, grandpa!
We've come!" The door opened; the little fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rushed into his grandpa's arms; and golden curls and thin
gray locks were mingled for an instant. Then the young
arms were thrown around dear Aunt Susie; and such a
welcome was given as little boys love to have.</p>

<p>Harry then trotted off to the kitchen to find his friend
Patty, the cook. In a few minutes he came running back,
exclaiming, "O mamma! do come and see what a big <i>pop-corner</i>
Patty has in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Corn-popper, I suppose you mean," said his mamma,
laughing, as she and Aunt Susie followed him to the kitchen.
There, hanging behind the stove, was a large brass pan, as
bright as gold: it had a cover full of holes, and a long handle.
This was what Harry took for a corn-popper.</p>

<p>"Oh! that is a warming-pan," said his mother. "A
what kind of a pan?" said Harry with great surprise.
"What <i>do</i> you mean, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Well, Harry, if you can be quiet a minute, I will tell you.
When your Aunt Susie and I were little girls, and your uncles
little boys, grandpapa's house was not warmed all over, as it
is now. Furnaces were not used in those days; and the
bed-rooms up stairs were very cold.</p>

<p>"So, on the coldest nights of winter, grandma would
have this pan filled with hot coals, and the beds all nicely
warmed. Sometimes the boys would have great frolics; for
dear grandmamma would have their bed so very warm, that,
as soon as they had jumped in, <i>out</i> they would come, saying
they were burned.</p>

<p>"But they would spring back again, and cuddle down,
and laugh, and tell stories, and sing, until grandpapa would
have to come to the foot of the stairs, and call out, 'Boys,
boys, I must have less noise!'"</p>

<p>"Well," said Harry after hearing this story, "I should
like to try it, and see how my little uncles felt so long ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Will you warm my bed to-night, Patty?"&mdash;"Oh, yes!
indeed I will. Master Harry," said Patty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus133.png" width="277" height="209" alt="A big corn-popper" title="A big corn-popper" />
</div>

<p>Harry wanted to go to bed earlier than usual that night;
and, before seven o'clock, he ran to the kitchen to ask Patty
to put the coals in the pan. Patty took a shovel, and first
put in some hot ashes. "What is that for?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"So the sheets will not be burned," said Patty. Then
she put in some glowing coals, and told Harry that the
warming-pan was ready.</p>

<p>Harry called his mamma; and they went up to the square
front-room. Patty gave the cold sheets a good warming
while mamma was unbuttoning the little shoes and clothes;
and, when Harry had got on his night-gown, he said, "Now
for a good jump,&mdash;one, two, three, four, and away!"</p>

<p>Then he sprang into the warm nest; and such a shout as
the little fellow gave made even grandpa start from his
rocking-chair. "Oh, goody! oh, how <i>jolly</i>! oh, how splen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>did!"
said Harry. "I thought grandpapa's house was
splendid in the summer; but it is a great deal <i>splendider</i>
in the winter.</p>

<p>"But, mamma," continued he, "won't I have a nice story
to tell Charlie and Susie when I get home, about this big
pop-corner?"</p>

<h2>WHAT DEMPSEY IS PROUD OF.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> are you proudest of?" said Mattie to Bertie.
"I'm proudest of my new red-top boots," said Bertie. "<i>I'm</i>
proudest of my new black hat," said Clay. Mattie was
proudest of her muff and boa. Little Bell was proudest of
her wax doll.</p>

<p>But Dempsey had the queerest pride of all. He had no
boots or mittens; and his clothes were coarse and worn.
What had he to be proud of? This is what he said, "I'm
proudest of my papa's wooden leg." The other little people
were too polite to laugh at him; but they looked at him
with wonder.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you," said he, "why I'm proud of my papa's
wooden leg. One time when there was a war, and men were
wanted to help fight the battles, my papa took his gun, and
went into the army. And when there was a great battle, and
men were shot down all around him, my papa stood beside
the man that held the flag. And, when the man was killed,
my papa would not let the flag fall, but took it in his own
hands. Then the soldiers on the other side fired at the
flag with a big cannon; and the ball took off my papa's leg.
He was sick a long time; but he got a letter from his commander
that said he was a brave man, and had done his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
duty nobly. This is why I am proud of my papa's wooden
leg."</p>

<p>Mattie and Bertie and Clay and Bell all thought that this
was a pretty story; and Clay said, "Dempsey is right. He
has something more to be proud of than any of us."</p>

<h2>WHAT MAMIE DID.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mamie</span> is a little girl five years old, with bright black
eyes, and rosy red cheeks.</p>

<p>She is very fond of "The Nursery," as are a great many
other Mamies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 227px;">
<img src="images/illus137.png" width="227" height="300" alt="Getting subscribers" title="Getting subscribers" />
</div>

<p>Now, which Mamie is this story about? They are all
wondering, but cannot tell certainly, till they have heard it
read.</p>

<p>Well, one cold winter's day, <i>this</i> little Mamie came to her
mother with a very urgent request. What do you suppose
it was? To go out coasting? No.</p>

<p>To go to visit her little friend Nellie? No.</p>

<p>To take a sleigh-ride with her papa? Wrong again.</p>

<p>Ah! you can never guess, and I will tell you.</p>

<p>It was this: "O mamma! do put on my things, and let
me go out and get <i>ex</i>scribers for 'The Nursery.'"</p>

<p>Mamma shook her head; though she could not help laugh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>ing
at the little girl's mistake, for she meant <i>sub</i>scribers. It
<i>is</i> a hard word; but this little Mamie knew the meaning
well.</p>

<p>"O mamma! <i>please</i> do; for you know <i>I</i> love it. And Jennie
and Katie and Bessie will love it too, if they only <i>know</i>
about it; and, besides, I can get a present, if I send some
new names to 'The Nursery' man."</p>

<p>Little Mamie was so urgent in her request, that her
mother asked papa what he thought about it.</p>

<p>Papa said, "Oh, let her try if she wants to: it will do no
harm." How the black eyes danced! and the little feet
could hardly keep still, while mamma dressed her up very
warmly, till she was just about as large one way as the other.</p>

<p>"Now, mamma, for my muff; and, oh! I must have a
'Nursery' to show." So, with a "Nursery" sticking out of
one end of the little muff, this Mamie started on her errand.
All the way along to Bessie's house, she kept saying, <i>sub</i>scribe,
<i>sub</i>scribe, so that she might not make another mistake
in the word.</p>

<p>She was gone but an hour, and returned with the names
of six children, who were to be made glad each month by
the visits of Mamie's friend.</p>

<p>Mamie was full of glee, and could hardly eat any supper,
so anxious was she for her papa to send the names to
Boston.</p>

<p>Well, they were all sent; and the six little friends have
been made glad by receiving each a "Nursery" of her own;
and next month they will be glad again, and so on for a
whole year.</p>

<p>Did Mamie get a present? Oh, yes! She got a present
from "The Nursery" man, which she values very highly.</p>

<p>Now, can you tell <i>which</i> little Mamie this is?</p>

<h2>SNIP'S STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> name is Snip. You can read it on my collar: though
why my master put it there I can't tell; for everybody
knows me, and almost everybody is my friend. People stop
in the street to pat me; the little children love to have me
play with them, because I never snarl and bite; and the
butcher round the corner saves me a bone every day. I
think butchers are very nice men.</p>

<p>Every morning I go down street to get the newspaper for
my master. The bookseller always has it rolled up, waiting
for me, and puts it in my mouth; and back I trot as fast as
my legs will go. To-day I had a hard time of it; for, just as
I got nicely started for home, some bad boys who were playing
in the road saw me, and thought it would be fine fun to
catch me, and take my paper away.</p>

<p>They ran after me, hooting and yelling; and I was so
frightened, that I trembled all over. But I could run faster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
than they; and they soon gave up the chase. That was not
the end, though; for one of them threw a stone after me, which
hit me on one of my paws, and so I came home limping.
But do you suppose I let the newspaper drop? Not a bit of it.</p>

<p>I have been barking at this door a long time; and yet nobody
comes to open it. I wonder where my master is, that
he doesn't hear me. Perhaps he is asleep. I am very hungry
for my dinner; and I should like to get into the house,
and lie down in my corner by the kitchen-fire.</p>

<p>I can push open the garden-gate with my nose; but this
door won't move a bit when I put my paws on it. I wonder
why dogs can't open doors as well as gates. I am going to
bark again. Bow-wow-wow! There! Didn't you hear a
footstep? Yes: there comes some one to let me in.</p>

<h2>NAMING THE KITTEN.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> shall be the kitten's name?" asked Rachel of her
younger sister, who stood holding up her apron, and begging
to take the little pet.</p>

<p>"It is <i>my</i> kitten," pleaded Alice; "and I ought to have it."</p>

<p>"The old cat evidently thinks it is <i>her</i> kitten. Hark!
Hear her mew! 'Mine, mine, mine,' she seems to say."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Alice, "I can soon quiet the old cat with a
saucer of milk. Come, give me the kitten; that's a good
Rachel!"</p>

<p>"Well, I will give it to you on one condition."</p>

<p>"Name it: perhaps I can grant it."</p>

<p>"The condition is, that you give the kitten a name,&mdash;a
name that I shall approve of."</p>

<p>"Oh! that I can do right off. We will call her Arabella."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! that is too long and grand a name for a kitten.
It will do very well for a proud lady-doll from Paris,
but not for this little scratcher."</p>

<p>"How would you like the name of Betsy?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thing'">think</ins> it a homely sort of name."</p>

<p>"Well, will any of these do?&mdash;Pet, Muff, Tabby, Tit, Tip-top,
Scamper, Nap, Mop, Pop, Grab?"</p>

<p>"I think you must have got those from some story-book."</p>

<p>"You guessed right that time," said Alice. "Name the
kitten yourself, if none of my names will satisfy you. Put
her in my lap, and I will get some cream, and let her lap it."</p>

<p>"Lappit, did you say? That's a new name, and a good
one!" cried Rachel. "You have hit upon a name at last.
We will call the kitten Lappit. Now hold up your apron,
and I will put Lappit in your lap."</p>

<p>Alice laughed at her sister's play upon the word; and,
taking the kitten in her apron, she ran off into the garden,
followed by the old cat.</p>

<h2>LITTLE GILBERT.</h2>

<h3>A TRUE STORY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago a little boy, named Gilbert, lived in a
small town in New Brunswick, on the banks of the St. John
River. The river is deep and swift; and Gilbert's papa had
often warned him not to go too near the brink.</p>

<p>One day, when the little fellow was about six years old,
he went with his papa down to the river; and, while his papa
stopped to talk with a friend, Gilbert wandered along the
shore.</p>

<p>He took with him his fishing-rod, and thought it would be
fine fun to catch a fish all by himself: so he went close to
the edge of the water, and dropped in his line.</p>

<p>After waiting a few minutes without getting a bite, he
thought he would walk out on a raft that he saw close by,
and try his luck in a new spot. He crept along till he
reached the outer edge of the raft; but then, as he threw out
his line, his little bare feet slipped, and over he went, plump
into the river. A splash, a scream, and down he went.</p>

<p>At the time of this story, there were a good many Indians
in New Brunswick; and a party of them were in camp in the
woods near the river. They were harmless, peaceable Indians,
and very friendly to the boys of the neighborhood,
who liked to visit their tents, and see them weave baskets,
and make bows and arrows, and scarlet slippers, and other
pretty things.</p>

<p>Luckily for Gilbert, an Indian boy happened to be fishing
near the raft, and saw him slip off into the water. Although
the Indian boy was not much older than Gilbert,
he was larger and stronger, and he knew how to swim. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
an instant he plunged into the river, seized the poor little
drowning boy, and brought him to the land safe and sound.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus147.png" width="277" height="211" alt="Little Gilbert saved" title="Little Gilbert saved" />
</div>

<p>His papa took him in his arms, all wet and dripping, and,
after thanking the brave Indian boy for his noble deed,
hurried home, scolding Gilbert by the way for disobedience.
Poor little Gilbert was very miserable. It was not at all nice
to be wet and frightened and scolded all at once; and, worse
than all, he feared he would be punished when he got home.</p>

<p>So, when his papa carried him into the kitchen, it was
a great comfort to the little fellow to see his good grandmother
sitting by the fire. She was very fond of Gilbert;
and, when she saw what a plight he was in, she begged his
papa not to punish the dear child this time, saying she
was sure he had been punished enough already by his fright
and his ducking.</p>

<p>His papa was so happy to have his little boy alive and
safe, that it was easy to forgive him; and in a little while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Gilbert was dressed in dry clothes, and sat down on his little
stool before the fire to eat a red apple which his grandmother
had brought him.</p>

<p>That night, when little Gilbert said his prayer, he put in
at the end, "God bless the brave Indian boy who saved my
life!"</p>

<h2>WHAT BIRDIE SAW IN TOWN.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Birdie</span>," you must know, is a little girl three and a half
years old. Her real name is Maud; but "Birdie" is her pet
name.</p>

<p>One day she went to the city in the horse-cars with her
mamma. They waited on the corner of the street till a car
came in sight; then Birdie held up her little fat finger, and
the conductor saw it, and stopped the car.</p>

<p>After they were seated, the conductor called out, "Fares,
ladies!" And Maud said to him, "Here is mamma's ticket;
and won't you please leave us at grandpa's house?" He
smiled, and nodded his head, and Birdie felt satisfied; for
she thought he must know, of course, where grandpa lived.</p>

<p>When they reached town, mamma took her into a store
where birds are kept for sale; and Birdie saw, to her great
delight, hundreds of canary-birds, and a good many bright-colored
parrots. It was very funny indeed to hear them all
singing and chattering together.</p>

<p>There were two beautiful birds in a large cage, taking
their morning bath. They would jump down into their little
bath-tub, dip their heads in the water, and then plunge
in all over; then they would perch on the side of the tub,
shake the bright drops from their feathers, and seem to be
enjoying themselves as much as Birdie herself does when
mamma puts her into her bath-tub.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus149.png" width="277" height="209" alt="Birdie at the pet shop" title="Birdie at the pet shop" />
</div>

<p>Then there were some squirrels in a cage that went round
and round; and Birdie thought she should never get tired
of looking at them, with their bushy tails and bright black
eyes. She saw them crack some nuts with their little sharp
teeth.</p>

<p>There were also a great many goldfishes in a little pond;
and Birdie watched them darting through the water, and
thought how nice it would be to have some of them at home.</p>

<p>One thing more Birdie saw, which pleased her very much.
On the corner of the street stood a man with a basket on his
arm; and in it were four or five little black-and-white puppies
("baby-dogs" Birdie called them), all cuddled up in a
heap, and looking very comfortable in their wicker-carriage.</p>

<p>The little girl took good care to point out all the sights
to Daisy, her doll, whom she carried in her arms, and who
always has to take an airing when her little mistress does.</p>

<h2>PRINCE AND TIP.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> is a small shaggy dog, of a light-brown color.
Tip is also a small dog, but is black, and has short, smooth
hair. They are very fond of each other, and frolic together
like two kittens.</p>

<p>Prince is always making acquaintances. He has several
places in the neighborhood where he makes himself at home.
He is always welcome, and he knows it: so he comes and
goes as he pleases. Even when his master ties him, he cannot
be kept from visiting his friends.</p>

<p>It was for a long time a wonder to us how he got untied;
but we kept watch one day, and found that Tip,
with his paws and mouth, loosened the knot, so that Prince
could slip his head out; and then the two dogs scampered
off in great glee. Prince, or Pinny, as we call him, plays
some funny tricks. When we tell him to shake hands, he
stands up on his hind-feet, and gives first his right, and then
his left paw.</p>

<p>Sometimes we say to him, "Now, Pinny, play sick."
Then he lies down, droops his head, and puts on a woe-begone
look. We run around him, saying, "Poor Pinny!" and
he all the while seems to enjoy the joke. As soon as we
say, "Up Pinny, all well," he jumps up, shakes himself, and
gives a knowing look, which seems to say, "Didn't I do that
well?"</p>

<p>When we tell him to play beggar, he sits up on his
haunches, raises his fore-paws, and whines dolefully.</p>

<p>When we hear a noise, and say, "See if anybody's
coming, Pinny!" he goes to the door, and listens: if any
one is coming, he barks loudly; if not, he comes quietly
back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the two dogs play horses. Their master takes
a rope a few feet long, and ties one end around Pinny's neck,
and the other around Tip's. Then, when the word is given,
they set off and gallop up the road abreast, like two ponies.
When their master whistles, they turn round, and come
back.</p>

<p>Sometimes they are harnessed to a little wagon; and the
children take turns in having a ride. The dogs seem to
enjoy it as much as the children. They are impatient to
start; but they wait for each other to be harnessed: they
are not in quite such a hurry as the dog in the following
picture.</p>

<h2>THE NAPOLEON VIOLETS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are three profiles of famous persons to be found
among the outlines of this picture, which was drawn as long
ago as the year 1815. One of the profiles is of Napoleon
Bonaparte, a great soldier, who made himself emperor of
France; another profile is of his wife, Marie Louise; and
another of his son, Napoleon Francis Charles Joseph Bonaparte,
styled King of Rome, and by his father proclaimed
Emperor of the French, under the title of Napoleon II., in
the year 1815, when he was only about four years old.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/illus153.png" width="249" height="300" alt="Violets" title="Violets" />
</div>

<p>Owing to the defeats and disappointments of his father,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the child Napoleon never actually became either King of
Rome, or Emperor of France. He died in the year 1832, in
Austria, where his grandfather was emperor.</p>

<p>Now, which of our readers will be able to discover the
three portraits hidden in this symbolical bunch of violets?</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! What a big word is this! What does Uncle
Charles mean by <i>symbolical</i>?" I fancy some of my little
friends will exclaim. Well, then, a <i>symbol</i> is merely a sign,
or mark, by which one knows a thing. When you see an
umbrella in a man's hand, it is a symbol, or sign, that he
expects a shower. So the profiles in this bunch of violets
make it <i>symbolical</i>; that is, suggestive of a family group,
who, it was hoped, would be renewed like the violets, and
once more fill a large space in the history of France.</p>

to consult together. "Here
we will remain," said my father.
"Look at the cherry-trees and
the grape-vines. We have found the right place at last."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>After looking carefully about for some time, they chose
for their home a new house with a projecting
roof, before which stood three
large cherry-trees in full bloom. My
mother, with the help of my father,
built a nest high up under the roof of
the house, and lined it with soft feathers. She laid four eggs,
but hatched out only one little sparrow;
and I was that lucky one.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 115px;">
<img src="images/illus155b.png" width="115" height="77" alt="Feeding" title="Feeding" />
</div>

<p>My parents fed me constantly with tender
worms; and it is no wonder that the
feathers began to grow on my naked little
body, or that my father soon thought me able to fly. So
one fine day I stood on the edge of the
nest, fluttered my wings, and flew out of
my father's house. With many fears and
a beating heart I at last alighted on an
acacia-tree. While I sat there, I saw many large birds
walking about, and also a cat, against whom my mother had
already warned me; and, directly over my head, I heard
the scream of a hawk.</p>

</div>

<p>In my fright, I cried out bitterly; but when the
cat ran away, and the hawk flew into the woods near
by, I grew calm again. My cry soon brought my
mother to my side; and my father came, bringing
a delicious worm to comfort me.</p>

<p>Before many days I was able take care of myself. About
this time I met with an adventure. One day
I saw several of my comrades fly in through
an open window. Wishing to know what they
found, I also flew in, and soon was as busy as
any of them eating the grains of wheat with which the floor
was covered. Suddenly the window was shut, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
were caught. A laughing boy put his hand over me, took
me up, then cut my wings, and let me
hop. He was very kind to me; but I
longed for my liberty. Fortunately
my wings soon grew; and one day,
when the window stood open, I flew
away, and found my mother again.</p>

</div>

<p>One sunny day in the autumn, my mother and I sat on a
gate, eating some grains of wheat. A sly old cat who had
hidden under a burdock which grew beside the gate, suddenly
sprang up, and seized my dear mother with her
sharp claws.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus156b.png" width="277" height="221" alt="The cat!" title="The cat!" />
</div>

<p>My mother was a very wise bird: so, instead of struggling
to get away, she remained so quiet, that Mrs. Pussy soon
thought she must be dead. Before long she put her down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
upon the grass, that she might admire at her leisure the nice
fat sparrow she had caught for her dinner. All at once up
flew my mother, and in an instant was far beyond the reach
of the cat.</p>

<p>Now I thought I was old enough to have a family of my
own. So I chose me a little sparrow-wife; but I had to
fight several battles before I could conquer all my rivals.
My bravery won her heart; and I
think she has been well content with
her choice. We built our nest, and
soon I had the pleasure of seeing
in it five bluish-white, brown-and-gray-dotted
eggs, and, fourteen days after, five pretty sparrows,&mdash;three
sons, and two daughters.</p>

</div>

<p>One saucy rogue, with a golden bill, we lost. Like me,
he was caught; but he never regained his liberty. A
friendly little maiden was his mistress, who made him so
tame, that he would eat from her hand. She gave him so
many dainties, that he became too fat, and died. I saw how
the little maiden dug him a grave in her garden. Bitterly
weeping, she placed him therein, covered him with earth,
and planted a cross of flowers on the little mound.</p>

</div>

<p>Our other children, one after the
other, founded homes of their own, and
all lived good and useful sparrow-lives.
The multitude of my grandchildren I
am no longer able to count.</p>

<h2>LITTLE MISCHIEF.</h2>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> mischief was there for Bessie to-day? The fish in
her mother's aquarium had not been benefited by the hot
bath which Bessie had given them; but that was no reason,
thought she, why a bath would not be a good thing for her
new doll Felicia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/illus158.png" width="284" height="300" alt="Felicia in the tub" title="Felicia in the tub" />
</div>

<p>She had a little doll bath-tub made of tin. So she put it
on a little table, and filled it from a jug of hot water which
happened to be on the hearth. Then she undressed Felicia,
and, holding her up, said, "Now, little lady, you are going
to have a nice warm bath: so be good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>Having put Felicia in the bath-tub, Bessie sat down in a
chair before her, and said, "There are not many dolls, little
lady, that have such a kind, loving mother as I am. You
ought to be very good and grateful."</p>

<img src="images/illus159.png" width="283" height="300" alt="Her head was ruined" title="Her head was ruined" />
</div>

<p>Here dolly slipped down in the bath-tub, and her nice
blooming face was all soaked in the hot water. When Bessie
took her out, you would hardly have known Felicia for
the same doll. Her head, which was of wax, was quite
ruined; and her whole body was out of shape and spoiled.</p>

<p>Bessie ran crying to her mother: but her mother said,
"You do not deserve to have another doll."</p>
